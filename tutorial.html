    <h3> Step 1: Draw a Circle </h3>
      <img src="photo of a circle">
      <p> This circle will be a guideline for the eyeline as well as the overall shape.</p>
    <h3> Step 1.5: Guidelines (cont'd) </h3>
      <img src="guideline photo">
      <p> The biggest pitfalls beginners fall into is anatomy. We're drawing a simple front-view face right now, so it isn't too complicated, but there are some rules into how parts of the face relate to each other. </p>
    <h3> Step 2: Place Features </h3>
      <img src="eyes n nose n mouth">
      <p> Now that you have your guidelines, you can place your features onto the face. Remember (especially for eyes) to sketch lightly, and then make darker marks when you have the general shape down. For eyes, use guidelines to make sure the width and height are the same before making definate shapes. </p>
    <h3> Step 3: Hair </h3>
      <img src="hair">
      <p> Hair is tricky, but there are certain things you can do to make it easier. One, remember about gravity. Most people aren't anime characters. Two, study the flow of hair. Look up how hair bunches up and where curls naturally fall. </p>
    <h3> Finished! </h3>
      <img src="finished">
      <p> Now you're finished! This tutorial is mostly focused on anatomy and how to draw a face, regardless of style. Keep drawing! :) </p>
