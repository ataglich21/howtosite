      <p> This circle will be a guideline for the eyeline as well as the overall shape.</p>
    <h3> Step 1.5: Guidelines (cont'd) </h3>
      <img src="part 2 tutorial.png">
      <p> The biggest pitfalls beginners fall into is anatomy. We're drawing a simple front-view face right now, so it isn't too complicated, but there are some rules into how parts of the face relate to each other. </p>
    <h3> Step 2: Place Features </h3>
      <img src="part 3 tutorial.png">
      <p> Now that you have your guidelines, you can place your features onto the face. Remember (especially for eyes) to sketch lightly, and then make darker marks when you have the general shape down. For eyes, use guidelines to make sure the width and height are the same before making definate shapes. </p>
    <h3> Step 3: Fill in features! </h3>
      <p> Because there are many ways a person can fill in features, I will only be draiwng the guidelines for the face. Feel free to use any style to sketch your features in! Remember, some people with different face shapes have slightly different variances, but for the most part, people tend to follow these rules. Have fun drawing! </p>
